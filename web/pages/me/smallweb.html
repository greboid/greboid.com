    <h1>Small Web</h1>
    <p>I'm not a fan of the centralisation of the internet.</p>
    <p>
        The early web was diverse, personal and sometimes downright weird. People made things for themselves and
        each other, not for metrics or money. Now we have a handful of platforms who own most of what we see and do
        online. Everything looks the same, feels the same, it's all optimised and (mostly) sanitised.

    <p>
        Centralisation isn't just boring, it can be brutal, you disagree with the consensus and all your
        content could disappear, along with the connections, history, friends, etc. If a platform dies or changes,
        you
        lose everything and there's no recourse. Everything is rented, not owned.

        The small web is people owning their little corners of the internet again. Personal sites, RSS, simple,
        small communities. It's not (just) about nostalgia, it's about remembering the internet used to
        have different goals, people goals, and we don't have to accept the direction we're told to go.
