    <h1>Automation</h1>
    <p>I like consistency, and I'm very lazy, automation helps with both.</p>
    <p>
        Automation isn't about making things faster (although it usually also does)
        it's about making things consistent, documented and reducing mistakes. When something is automated, it's
        done in a consistent manner every time it's done. You can't make typos, you can't skip over steps, and you
        can't make silly mistakes because you're distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also add some sanity checks on the automation, or some tests. It's hard to add sanity checks to
        procedures that are being done by hand, as you almost certainly trust yourself or will just skip the tests.
        Because automating normally means formalising the process, it also acts as some documentation, if you forget
        or leave.

        That said, it's easy to go overboard, I've definitely spent hours automating something that didn't need to
        be automated and didn't hugely benefit from being automated, but it was fun to do and made me feel good.
        It's not like I'm the only one, obligatory <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">xkcd</a> <a
