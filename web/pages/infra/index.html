            I host a large number of services I use myself, there are a few however just bring me no joy, or would
            be a considerable amount of hassle to host myself if it came to completely bootstrapping things. Notable
            things I don't self-host:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Email - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a> - No issues with the
                company or the service so no plans to leave any time soon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Passwords - <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a> - With the
                impending price rise, the constant UI changes that seem to make the product worse, and adding
                features I don't want - I'm on the lookout to change this.  Maybe I'll move to
                <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a>, maybe
                to another company, both <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://1password.com">1Password</a> and
                <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nordpass.com/">NordPass</a> seem to be reasonable.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When it comes to the servers themselves, I follow the philosophy that servers are cattle not pets,
            I should be able to get start using a new server with little effort with there being no special snowflakes.
            <a href="/infra/containers">Containers</a> help with this, as does <a href="/infra/tailscale">Tailscale</a>.
