        <h1>Small Web</h1>
        <h2>Early web</h2>
        <p>
            The early web was diverse, personal and sometimes downright weird. If you wanted a website, you made it, and
            because of that, it reflected you. Because it wasn't just a couple of clicks, you had to think about it,
            take some time on it, put some effort in; it wasn't spur of the moment. There were visitor counters,
            guestbooks and webrings, if you wanted to find a site you were interested in you had to find directories or
            discover it via other similar websites that linked to it. There was no central index.
        </p>
        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>
            As popularity grew, we started getting search engines that crawled all the sites for you and ranked them by
            popularity based on their own black box ranking systems. This was still a good trade-off, whilst it was
            still a central system that could be gamed, for the most part what you wanted was easy to find and the
            centralised index didn't control the content, it just helped it to be found. Obviously, determining which
            websites were "best" was now a decision being made by a company, and as a company they needed to make
            money.  Even back then this was advertising, but the ads were usually unobtrusive and based on what you
            searched for and nothing else. The other side effect of this was that sites started being designed around
            getting to the top result and content wasn't the number one priority any more for a lot of sites.
        </p>
        <h2>Blogging</h2>
        <p>
            As the internet developed it became more interactive, easier to get content onto. The first stage in this
            were blogs, WordPress, Blogger, LiveJournal, and others. The barrier for having your presence on the
            internet was lower, it was a lot easier to just throw your thoughts on the internet without too much effort.
            It was, however, still your space, your words, and (mostly) your rules. Each site had a feeling it belonged to
            someone, and you could see their personality shining through. It was the start of centralisation;
            you'd started losing some control over whether your site stayed up or not. There were T&Cs and AUPs you had
            to agree to for your content and unless you paid, adverts were starting to be shown on your site. Profiles
            where you shared your interests in a nice easy to collate place, friend lists and subscribers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Companies started to realise there was a lot of information available, and people were very happy to give
            more. Once you have more data you can do more with it, and so the platforms started to appear: Facebook,
            Twitter, and others. These platforms all had nice profiles where you added interests; it was very easy to
            not only share your thoughts, but also repost others' thoughts, click like, reply. With all the data they
            had available, recommendations about what you should be viewing became very easy to generate. "For you"
            sections appeared, powered by algorithms deciding what to show you.
        </p>
        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>
            Time-based timelines eventually gave way to engagement-based timelines. As this trend continued, everyone
            you knew was already on one of these platforms, so the barrier for entry got lower and there was an unspoken
            pressure to join. As the numbers grew, so did their influence - and with that growth came the constant push
            for quick-win, lowest-common-denominator engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the platforms had lots of users, and you were logged in anyway, so why not just use your platform's
            identity as an identity provider for other sites? It saves remembering another set of account details and
            reduces the friction. Your identity now wasn't just owned by the platform when you were on their platform,
            but also when you were on other places too. Everything is being centralised on a few small companies. The
            majority of a lot of people's interaction with the internet is now done entirely through these few
            companies. As the internet centralised on these few companies, not only did they try to exert more control
            over their users, their walled gardens expanded as they bought more and more of the other little companies
            trying to eke out a living.
        </p>
        <h2>Consequences</h2>
        <p>
            This centralisation leads to so many downsides for everyday choices and freedoms. With such large amounts of
            control, they abuse market forces to offer things cheaper than smaller companies, often doing so just long
            enough to starve the competition before hiking prices. With everything being reliant on a few small
            companies, resilience goes down.
        </p>
        <p>
            The consequences of this concentration became starkly visible in 2021, when a faulty configuration change
            took Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger offline globally for six hours; the outage also prevented
            anyone using 'Log in with Facebook' from accessing third-party sites. In 2024, a faulty update from security
            vendor CrowdStrike caused millions of Windows systems to crash, grounding flights at United, Delta and
            American Airlines, pulling Sky News off-air, and disrupting banks and healthcare providers worldwide. We've
            seen similar disruptions from AWS, Cloudflare and Google outages. When so few companies underpin so much,
            a single mistake ripples everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you disagree with the masses, or break the "rules", your account is disabled. You no longer have access to
            everything that you relied on, no emails, no social media, no friends, no history. Usually there is no
            recourse. Should payment processors be the moral guardians of the world refusing to process payments for
            industries they disagree with? If a particular service you like isn't getting the right engagement, or isn't
            profitable enough, it can be cancelled, all your data gone. Censorship is very easy to achieve when
            everything goes through a few places. Surveillance becomes very easy when everything goes through a few
            places. A slow siege and slow change, under the guise of being better, new, improved and with all the
            competition gone, things are shifting to suit the needs of the companies, not the people. Everything is
            rented, not owned.
        </p>
        <h2>Revival</h2>
        <p>
            There is, however, a revival of the founding principles of the web. People have started to see the pitfalls
            of this centralisation and are starting to reject the big platforms, moving back to something more
            resembling the early web. Call it the small web, the indie movement, the personal web, or whatever you feel
            suits - the intention is the same: a move back toward something owned and controlled by individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            In practice, this means people registering their own domains, setting up blogs, making their own websites.
            Joining communities of like-minded people, using RSS. The tools to do this have evolved significantly from
            the early web, static site generators, lightweight hosting, CSS and HTML have also evolved hugely making it
            much easier for things to look how you want with much less faff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motivations for it aren't all the same: longevity, knowing your site can last as long as you want; privacy,
            knowing your data isn't being harvested, and you're not harvesting that of others. Many are simply exhausted
            with doom-scrolling endless algorithmically recommended content. The underlying belief behind all
            of these motivations is approximately the same, the web doesn't have to be what it has become.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal sites matter. Basic HTML sites from the early internet still render absolutely fine today. They
            don't always look as polished as a modern website and their style is questionable, but they still work,
            easily outliving any of the big platforms. With no algorithm to reward your content, which is often outrage,
            controversy, relentless positivity or perfection, with no metrics to be aiming at, your content is just what
            matters, whether that's to thousands, dozens or just yourself. Diversity of form and content, you're no
            longer restrained to the same layout as every other Twitter user, no longer constrained to the Instagram
            grid; minimal, maximal, you decide.
        </p>
        <p>
            The internet is still, at its core, made of links. These links can lead anywhere, including back to a more
            personal, decentralised web.
