        <p>
            Networking is something I just really don't enjoy, it's a necessity and when it doesn't work it's very
            annoying, but I just don't find it interesting enough to want to put any effort into it.
            <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> has so far proved friction free and enabled some
            interesting use cases, their business philosophy also sits well with me, and the free tier shows this.
            Whilst I could probably self-host this with <a href="https://jsiebens.github.io/ionscale/">Ionscale</a> or
            <a href="https://headscale.net/">Headscale</a> for the minute it's easier to just leave the control plan
            with them.
