    <h1>Privacy</h1>
    <p>I rant about privacy quite a lot, a brief summary of my stance:</p>
    <p>
        Privacy is a fundamental human right, it's about choosing what to share, who to share it with and when to
        share it. We all do this on a daily basis, it's a basic social function. There's nothing wrong with closing
        a bathroom door when going to the toilet, or not wanting your employer listening your rant to your friends
        about your bad day. It's not nefarious or sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
        What's acceptable today might change tomorrow, what you think years ago may seem stupid and harmful to you
        today. When these choices weren't indelibly recorded on the internet forever, it wasn't as much of an issue,
        but people are more forgiving than you think and have short memories. Today these bad decisions can now
        stick with you forever, being used by banks, employers and even governments on making decisions about your
        life. Whilst you might not think any of this is bad now, can you be sure this won't be misunderstood, taken
        out of context, or simply judged differently by future standards?
    </p>
    <p>
        If you look toward the people who are so keen for you to give up your privacy you'll notice most of them
        fight for their own privacy very hard. How much information does Google, Meta, etc give you about how they
        work and operate? Are your politicians open books with no skeletons in their closet or hidden interests?
        Privacy isn't about having something to hide, nor having to justify every thought, mistake and bad day to
        people who may not extend you the same courtesy, it's about choice.
